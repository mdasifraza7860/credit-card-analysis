# Credit Card Analysis Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes credit card usage patterns, identifies key customer segments,
and predicts default likelihood using Python-based data analysis and machine learning techniques.

The goal is to help financial institutions understand customer behavior
and build better credit-risk strategies.

## 🧹 Steps Performed in the Project

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Handling missing values  
- Converting data types  
- Removing duplicates  
- Outlier detection  

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Distribution plots  
- Correlation heatmap  
- Segment-based analysis  
- Spending patterns  

### 3️⃣ Feature Engineering
- Creating new financial behavior metrics  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Normalization and scaling  

### 4️⃣ Machine Learning Models Used

## 📈 Key Insights
- High spenders with low credit score have higher default rate  
- Customers with consistent transaction behavior default less  
- Income level strongly correlates with credit usage patterns
